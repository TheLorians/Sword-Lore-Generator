# Sword-Lore-Generator
This makes sword lore (and other stuff)

Eamon's old to do list:
(I'll get to this stuff someday)
* Guilds
* Written engravings
* Warswords
* Book based enscriptions
* Enchanted/cursed swords
* Lost swords (like lost paintings)
* Rewrite language engine (Markov chains?)
* Add painters who are upset with their profession (Akteerg)
* Bugs (like literal bugs perhaps via the animal function in my new to do list)
  * Merge with worms

Eamon's new to do list:
(I'm working on this now)
* Make a general animal function
* Generalize swordlore to work for all weapons
* Create more class based general functions

Louis' to do list:
* Epithets
  * Add epithets for places and certain other inaminate objects
  * Add longer and potentially recursive epithets (recursive example: Hiln, son of Coel the mild)
* Guilds

Mark's to do list:
* Fix all of Eamon's dumb formatting mistakes

Future goals:
(features that will probably be in the final project but are a long way from even being startable)
* Read from xml (or json)
* Meta generator (perhaps)
* Itellegent interpretation
* GUI
